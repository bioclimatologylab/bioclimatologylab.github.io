                        <p class="bio">The Shiba Inu is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog from Japan. A
                            small, agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain, the Shiba Inu was originally
                            bred for hunting. It looks similar to and is often mistaken for other Japanese dog breeds like
                            the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a different breed with a distinct blood line,
                            temperament and smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds.</p>

                        <h3>Golden Retriever</h3>
                        <p class="bio">The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl such
                            as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever'
                            because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged (soft mouth). Golden Retrievers have
                            an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards.
                            They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth
                            in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden
                            Retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. Although they need
                            substantial outdoor exercise, they should be housed in a fenced area because of their instinctual
                            tendency to roam. They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly
                            regular grooming.</p>

                        <p class="bio">The Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog originally developed
                            in Australia for droving cattle over long distances across rough terrain. This breed is a medium-sized,
                            short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed
                            fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a "red" or "blue" dog.</p>

                        <h3>Corgi</h3>
                        <p class="bio">The Welsh Corgi, sometimes known as just a Corgi, is a small type of herding dog that originated
                            in Wales, United Kingdom. Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the
                            Cardigan Welsh Corgi. In 1925 the first Welsh Corgi was bred. Historically, the Pembroke has
                            been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century,
                            while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common
                            ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund. A certain degree of interbreeding between the two types has
                            been suggested to explain the similarities between the two.</p>

                            coat. It takes its name from the Samoyedic peoples of Siberia. These nomadic reindeer herders
                            bred the fluffy white dogs to help with the herding, and to pull sleds when they moved. An alternate
                            name for the breed, especially in Europe, is Bjelkier.</p>
